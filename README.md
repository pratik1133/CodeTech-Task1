Screenshot 2024-06-02 141419

Objective
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing population data from 1970 to 2022 for countries around the world. The aim is to uncover insights into population trends, distributions, correlations, and outliers through visualizations.

Key Activities
Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying correlations between population figures across different years.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
seaborn: Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.
Key Insights
Population Distributions: Histograms to show how populations have been distributed over time.
Inter-year Relationships: Scatter plots to reveal relationships between population data from different years.
Correlation Patterns: Heatmaps to display the correlation between populations over the years, highlighting significant trends and patterns.
This project provides a comprehensive overview of global population trends and insights, useful for further studies or policy-making related to demographic changes.
